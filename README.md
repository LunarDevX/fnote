# fnote
My first repository on GitHub. 

For my first repository on GitHub, I decided to create a simly post-it note program. 

The first Version contains a simple terminal Interface, where one can add a new note (title, tag, post-it note), display all notes, edit notes 
and sort them by date, title, tags.
