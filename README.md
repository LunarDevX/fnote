# fnote
My first repository on GitHub. 

For my first repository on GitHub, I decided to create a simly post-it note program. 

Version -0x:
- The first Version contains a simple terminal Interface, where one can add a new note (title, tag, post-it note), edit notes 
and sort them by date, title, tags. 
It creates a database named 'notes.db' with a table named 'overview' and the following columns: 
Id, Title, Date, Tag, Note. 

Version: -00: 
- Initialize an ASCII Text
- one can add a new note
